##Prerequisites##

* Rabit MQ
* Erlang OTP

## Java ##
If you have Java 8 or higher installed, the quickest way to get started is to fetch the latest release as a self-contained executable jar:

wget -O zipkin.jar 'https://search.maven.org/remote_content?g=io.zipkin.java&a=zipkin-server&v=LATEST&c=exec'
RABBIT_URI=amqp://localhost java -jar zipkin.jar


## Running from Source ##
Zipkin can be run from source if you are developing new features. To achieve this, you’ll need to get Zipkin’s source and build it.

# get the latest source
git clone https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin
cd zipkin

# Build the server and also make its dependencies
./mvnw -DskipTests --also-make -pl zipkin-server clean install
# Run the server
RABBIT_URI=amqp://localhost java -jar ./zipkin-server/target/zipkin-server-*exec.jar
